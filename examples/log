◘1 quote | Bertrand Russell
The trouble with the modern world is that the stupid are cocksure while the
intelligent are full of doubt.
◘1 quote | Isaac Asimov
The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge
faster than society gathers wisdom.
◘1 quote | Kurt Vonnegut
We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend
to be.
◘1 recipe | Gazpacho
Combine one pound tomatoes cut into chunks, a cucumber peeled and cut into
chunks, two or three slices stale bread torn into pieces, a quarter-cup
olive oil, two tablespoons sherry vinegar and a clove of garlic in a
blender with one cup water and a couple of ice cubes. Process until smooth,
adding water if necessary. Season with salt and pepper, then serve or
refrigerate, garnished with anchovies if you like, and a little more olive
oil.
◘1 recipe | Egg in a hole, glorified
Tear a hole in a piece of bread and fry in butter. Crack an egg into the
hole. Deglaze pan with a little sherry vinegar mixed with water, and more
butter; pour over egg.
